# License-Scanner

This tool is designed to scan through all of your repositories on GitHub and determine what percentage of your libraries
have a license in them.

## Roadmap

Current plans for what this tool will be able to do:

- Scan public all public repos of a user for licenses
- Report what percentage of repos have a license.
- Report what repositories are missing a license
- Scan license file to determine what license type is in use.
